# marvel-card-game
This is code from a Marvel-inspired card game based on Top Trumps.
I worked on the code with another student (Ashwin) for a group project during my IT Masters.
This is the section of code I was responsible for (along with Ashwin), making a command-line version of Top Trumps.
The other members of the team worked on the SQL and Json parts of the project.

The code formatting follow's my coding partner's style as I was happy to try out a different approach (e.g. both curly brackets are on new lines like in C#).
